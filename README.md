Re-implementation of https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler in TypeScript.

- TODO
  - Add combined usecase tests as a description of usage of the program.
  - Change description of each test case to clarify specifications of each module.
    - eg: For the parser tests:  'returns an empty ast' -> 'Parser takes an emplty tokens and returns an ast with an empty body.'
